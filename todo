core stuff:
x allow moving pieces
x allow capturing pieces
x allow cancelling selections
x add cooldowns
x disallow illegal moves
- add win condition: taking opponent's king
  x stop taking inputs
  - show win screen
  - allow restarting game maybe?
x add auto promotion to queen
x add controller support
x add premoves

other core stuff discovered while working on core stuff:
x unselect if selected piece is taken
x add move indicators
x handle enemy taking select piece
x cancel premoves as soon as they are illegal

fancy but important fun stuff:
- draw different move indicator for taking pieces
- animations
  x piece move animation
  - piece death animation
- sounds
- title screen with some fun starting countdown?

x randomize player we do actions for first every frame
(inputs can come in on same frame, lets make it fair)

future stuff:
- consider using seb's premove logic

idea:
x maybe make b allow x2 movement
- 2v2 TEAMS hype

things i wanna do:
- sounds
x animations
- UI for ready up and restart?

- make sure piece z index makes sense for animations (pieces moved recently should be on top)
- maybe change cooldown visual to be pie chart?
