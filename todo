core stuff:
x allow moving pieces
x allow capturing pieces
x allow cancelling selections
x add cooldowns
x disallow illegal moves
- add win condition: taking opponent's king
  x stop taking inputs
  - show win screen
  - allow restarting game maybe?
x add auto promotion to queen
- add controller support
x add premoves

other core stuff discovered while working on core stuff:
x unselect if selected piece is taken
x add move indicators
x handle enemy taking select piece
x cancel premoves as soon as they are illegal

fancy but important fun stuff:
- draw different move indicator for taking pieces
- animations
  - piece move animation
  - piece death animation
- sounds
- title screen with some fun starting countdown?

- randomize player we do actions for first every frame
(inputs can come in on same frame, lets make it fair)

future stuff:
- consider using seb's premove logic

idea:
- maybe make b allow x2 movement
- 2v2 TEAMS hype
