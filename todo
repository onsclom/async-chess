core stuff:
x allow moving pieces
x allow capturing pieces
x allow cancelling selections
x add cooldowns
x disallow illegal moves
x add win condition: taking opponent's king
  x stop taking inputs
  x show win screen
  x allow restarting game maybe?
x add auto promotion to queen
x add controller support
x add premoves

other core stuff discovered while working on core stuff:
x unselect if selected piece is taken
x add move indicators
x handle enemy taking select piece
x cancel premoves as soon as they are illegal

fancy but important fun stuff:
- draw different move indicator for taking pieces
- animations
  x piece move animation
  - piece death animation
- sounds
x title screen with some fun starting countdown?

x randomize player we do actions for first every frame
(inputs can come in on same frame, lets make it fair)

future stuff:
- consider using seb's premove logic

idea:
x maybe make b allow x2 movement
- 2v2 TEAMS hype

things i wanna do:
- sounds
x animations
- UI for ready up and restart?

- make sure piece z index makes sense for animations (pieces moved recently should be on top)
- maybe change cooldown visual to be pie chart?

- implement key repeat for directions!

- maybe checks actually put all pieces on cool down except for pieces that can prevent the check?

things i'd like to do today:
- add death animations
- make loading indicators circular
x show enemy cursor and selection
x add scale animation to pieces
x make different move indicators for taking pieces
- add sounds to more things:
  - countdown
  - select
  - deselect
  - game over
x add castling
- add button repeat

ideas:
- checks put all pieces on cool downs except for pieces that can prevent the check
- taking pieces could help lower cooldowns ?

7/4 ideas:
- on win, show raining pieces of the winner's color
- add tie timeout timer
  - add scoring system to limit ties
    - (add up piece values, and use pawn advancement as tie breaker)

add teams??:
- controller select:
